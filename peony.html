            <p>Peonies are revered for their opulent blooms, symbolizing prosperity, honor, and romance.</p>
            <p>Found in
                shades of pink, red, and white, these luxurious flowers are popular in weddings and bouquets for their
                lavish appearance. </p>
            <p>
                Originating from Asia, Europe, and North America, peonies hold cultural
                significance, particularly in Chinese culture, where they are regarded as the "king of flowers".
