            <p>Sunflowers are synonymous with warmth, happiness, and longevity, boasting large, sunny blooms that track
                the sun's movement.</p>
            <p>Native to the Americas, sunflower seeds are nutritious and used for oil, while
                the flowers themselves are popular subjects for art and photography. </p>
            <p>Symbolizing joy and brightness,
                sunflowers bring a sense of optimism wherever they bloom.</p>
